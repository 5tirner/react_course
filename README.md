# Why I need react?

 - React Is a javascript library that allows me creating single page web application easy way:
 `It means that the server of the front-end need only to send one html page to the browser for the website run`.
 - So it's very useful and i will only refresh the back-end.
 - Benifits: The Website will respond very quickly than send request to the server every time i want to     change the url.
