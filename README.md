# Why I need react?

 - React Is a javascript library that allows me creating single page web application easy way:
 `It means that the server of front-end need only to send one Html page to the browser for the website run`.
 - So it's very useful and i will only refresh the back-end.
 - Benifits: The Website will respond very quickly than send request to the server every time i want to
  change the url.

# Setup project

 - Install node `apt install nodejs`.
 - Install npm to help us creating react app `apt install npm`.
 - Create react application using npx: `npx create-react-app appName`.

# Framwork structure

 - node_modules: Here where our dependencies stored.
 - public: All the files in this folder are public o the browser, also this folder contains the file where all of our react code injected: `index.html`.
 - src: the things take place here, so aproximitly all the work will be done here.
  - ## src elements:
    - So the src folder is the place where we create the compenent and it contains those files:
      - App.js: The root compenent.
